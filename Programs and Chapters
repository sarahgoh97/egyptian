1.1.1 Expressions
- remove division operations (because it violates the only integers thing)
- remove decimals

1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
- pythagorean theorem
    - Pythagoras lived in Egypt
    - pythagorasConstants.js
- can keep example of circles maybe?
            - examples of pyramid with height and base (surface area/volume)
            - examples of const with dividing wages (rice, workers)
                - maybe not this

1.1.3 Evaluating Operator Combinations
- no change to JS parts

1.1.4 Functions
- pythagorean theorem
    - keep the square examples
    - use sum of squares
    - pythagorasFunction.js
            - finding pyramid stuff
                - a bit too complicated, requires division


1.1.5 The Substituion Model for Functional Application
- keep same explanation for square and sum of squares

1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates
- checking proper fractions
    - sometimes the denominator smaller than numerator because its negative and
    the numerator is positive
    - need to use absolute function to check
        - keep abs function in book
    - add function to test proper fraction
        - checkProperFraction.js
    - take out exercises with division inside (1.1, 1.2)

1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method -> Example: Ceiling and Floor
- example of ceiling and floor as mathematical functions and how it looks like
with computer functions
- doing subtraction recursively
    - function division(big, small) {}
        - initially returns only quotient
        - remainder is missing - need another one for remainder
    - integer division functions here
        - integerDivisionQuotientRecursive.js
        - integerDivisionRemainderRecursive.js
    - ceiling function
        - ceilingRecursive.js

1.1.8 Functions as Black-Box Abstractions
- multiple ways of doing the smaller functions (same as book)
- lexical scoping with division stuff in ceiling function
    - ceilingBlock.js


1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration
- recursive vs. iterative version of integer division functions
- keeping a counter until it exceeds the bigger number
    - integerDivisionQuotientIterative.js
    - integerDivisionRemainderIterative.js

1.2.2 Tree Recursion
