            In this section, it emphasises the importance of functions in
            programming to be used to build abstractions by being to manipulate
            other functions.

        We have seen that
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
        are, in effect, abstractions that describe compound operations on
	numbers independent of the particular numbers. For example, when we
	<SPLITINLINE>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>declare</JAVASCRIPT>

        we are not talking about the product of 2 particular fractions
        <!--the cube of a particular number, -->
        but rather about a method for obtaining the product of any 2 fractions.
<!--          cube of any number. -->
          Of course we could get along without ever
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>defining this procedure,</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>declaring these functions,</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
	by always writing expressions such as
        <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
          <JAVASCRIPT>
3 * 3;
5 * 14;
x * y;
          </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SNIPPET>
        and never mentioning <!--<SCHEMEINLINE>cube</SCHEMEINLINE> -->
    <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>mul_frac_num</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> explicitly. This
	would place us at a serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at
	the level of the particular operations that happen to be primitives in
	the language (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of
	higher-level operations. Our programs would be able to compute
    multiplication of fractions <!--cubes-->,
	but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of
         <!--cubing.--> multiplying fractions.
	One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language
	is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common
        patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly.
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>Procedures</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>Functions</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
        provide this ability.  This is why all but the most primitive
	programming languages include mechanisms for 
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>defining procedures.</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>declaring functions.</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
        Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our
        ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
        whose parameters must be numbers.  Often the same programming pattern
        will be used with a number of different
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>procedures.</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>functions.</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
	To express such patterns as concepts, we will need to construct
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
        that can accept
        <SPLITINLINE>
	  <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
	  <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
	</SPLITINLINE>
        as arguments or return
