        Egyptian fractions are a unique way of representing and using fractions.
        This is because the Ancient Egyptians only used unit fractions which are
        fractions that have a numerator of 1 <INDEX>Knott, Ron</INDEX>
        (Knott 2020). In other words,
        they only used reciprocals as fractions. For example,
        <LATEX>
            $\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{14}, 2^{-1}$
        </LATEX>
        are used by the Egyptians but
        <LATEX>
            $\frac{5}{6}, \frac{2}{14}$
        </LATEX>
        are not because their numerators are not 1. Hence, a different method is
        needed to represent these fractions that have a numerator greater than
        1. The Egyptians represented their fractions with positive, distinct
        unit fractions <INDEX>Knott, Ron</INDEX> (Knott 2020). Looking at the
        first example fraction,
        <LATEX>
            \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\]
        </LATEX>
        <LATEX>
            \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12}\]
        </LATEX>
        These representations are correct because they represent the fraction with
        distinct unit fractions. However, these examples would be wrong:
        <LATEX>
            \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\]
        </LATEX>
        This is wrong because the denominators in the second and third unit
        fractions are the same. Since the unit fractions are not distinct, this is
        an invalid representation.
        <LATEX>
            \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{6}\]
        </LATEX>
        This would also be wrong because the second unit fraction used is
        negative.

        Though Egyptian Fractions may seem vastly different from programming, it
        can help to explain the rationale of various essential concepts in
        programming to beginner students.
        <INDEX>Singapore Ministry of Education</INDEX> <INDEX>Kosheleva</INDEX>
        In Singapore, the syllabus released by the Ministry of Education in 2012
        introduces fractions to Primary 2 students, who would be around 7 to 8
        years old. Since fractions is a concept that many students are familiar
        with, using Egyptian Fractions could help them understand abstract
        computing concepts better. Over the decade, more teachers have been
        teaching the concept of Egyptian Fractions as seen in videos available
        online. Also, in Kosheleva's, Kreinovich's and Zapata's (2019) paper,
        they state that Egyptian Fractions is a topic that also helps young
        students understand fractions and be interested in learning fractions.
        Hence, Egyptian Fractions can make programming easier to grasp for new
        students as well as add a unique context to learning programming. At
        the same time, the mathematical complexity behind Egyptian Fractions
        discovered by previous mathematicians, like Paul
        Erd<LATEXINLINE>\"{o}</LATEXINLINE>s, can engage advanced students in a
        more challenging way.

        ``Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - JavaScript
        Adaptation<APOS/><APOS/> which can be found online at
        (<LATEXINLINE>\url{https://source-academy.github.io/sicp/}</LATEXINLINE>).
        This will cover the same concepts and will also be teaching JavaScript
        with the online environment developed by Henz (https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground).
        This provides a platform for students to learn programming with
        JavaScript in a more accessible manner.
