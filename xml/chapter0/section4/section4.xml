        The Egyptians represented numbers with their hieroglyphs as shown above
        in Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:natural-numbers"/>. With these
        numerals, the Egyptians did not use zero like we do with
        today's arabic numerals (Bidny 2014). However, they did have a special
        symbol for zero called nfr (Williams 2008). This was the same
        hieroglyph for beauty and completeness which is shown in
        Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:nfr"/>.

        This was how Egyptians understood numbers - with natural numbers. In
        their fractions, they represented then with a natural number above
        another natural number. Likewise, we normally represent fractions with
        2 integers placed vertically and a line between them to show
        which is the numerator and the denominator. Hence, to be like the
        Ancient Egyptians, we will use only natural numbers as we get into
        programming with Egyptian Fractions<FOOTNOTE>Though computers can
        represent other types of numbers, like negative numbers or decimals,
        they are not relevant in this context and we will not use them
        here.</FOOTNOTE>.

        However, to do that, we have to first know what natural numbers are. We
        will follow David Groisser's (2001) Peano's Axioms and Natural Numbers.
        He first  defines natural numbers as
        <LATEXINLINE>$\mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, ...}$</LATEXINLINE> and the
        <EM>Peano axioms</EM> below:
    </TEXT>
    <TEXT>
        Axioms: There exists a set <LATEXINLINE>$\mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE> and
        an injective function
        <LATEXINLINE>$s : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE>
        satisfying the properties below. For
        <LATEXINLINE>$n \in \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE>, we will call
        <LATEXINLINE>$s(n)$</LATEXINLINE> the successor of
        <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE>.
        <OL>
            <LI>
                There is an element ``1<APOS/><APOS/> that is not the
                successor of any element.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                Axiom of Induction: Let
                <LATEXINLINE>$M \subset \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE> be any
                subset such that
                <UL>
                  <LI>
                      if <LATEXINLINE>$1 \in M$</LATEXINLINE>, and
                  </LI>
                  <LI>
                      if <LATEXINLINE>$n \in M$</LATEXINLINE>, then
                      <LATEXINLINE>$s(n) \in M$</LATEXINLINE>.
                  </LI>
                </UL>
                Then, <LATEXINLINE>$N = \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE>
            </LI>
        </OL>
        Here, <LATEXINLINE>$s(n) = n + 1$</LATEXINLINE>, ie. the successor of
        a natural number is itself plus 1. From the second axiom, Groisser also
        gives the second axiom in the equivalent form: Suppose a statement
        is true when applied to 1, and for all
        <LATEXINLINE>$n \in \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE>, if the statement is true
        for <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE>, then it is true for
        <LATEXINLINE>$s(n)$</LATEXINLINE>. Then, the statement is true for all
        <LATEXINLINE>$n \in \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE>.

        As we look at this definition of natural numbers, we can see that there
        are naturally 2 functions that we can use on any 2 natural numbers such
        that it returns only natural numbers, as defined by Groisser:

        <UL>
            <LI>
                <LATEXINLINE>$plus : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
                \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE> denoted by <LATEXINLINE>$plus(m, n)
                = m + n$</LATEXINLINE>
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <LATEXINLINE>$times : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
                \mathbb{N}$</LATEXINLINE> denoted by <LATEXINLINE>$times(m, n)
                = m \cdot n$</LATEXINLINE>
            </LI>
        </UL>

        As we write programs, we will also stick to using the plus and times
        functions on the natural numbers that we will be using. We will
        elaborate more on how to use these functions later in the book. Though
        JavaScript has other mathematical operations, we will not be using them
        since we are restricting ourselves to the set of natural numbers in our
        programs.

        For the Ancient Egyptians, the numbers in the powers of 2 were special
        to them. Likewise, the binary system is also very relevant to computer
        science. When looking at the lower levels of a computer, we see that
        computers only understand 0s and 1s which are numbers with a base of 2,
        instead of our usual base 10 in mathematics that we use. This is also
        known as machine language. When we program, we use identifiers and
        syntax that we can read and understand. As we compile, these programs
        are converted into 0s and and return the result.
