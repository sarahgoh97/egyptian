        The Egyptians did not have a concept of numbers other than natural
        numbers. Even in their fractions they were represented by integers
        placed in a certain order. Likewise, when we deal with fractions we use
        2 natural numbers placed vertically and a line between them to show
        which is the numerator and the denominator. Hence, we will also limit
        ourselves to using only natural numbesr as we get into the programming
        with Egyptian Fractions. Though computers can represent other types of
        numbers, like negative numbers of decimals, they are not relevant in
        this context and we will not use them here.

        As we see again below, the numbers in the powers of 2 are special to the
        Egyptians. Likewise, the binary system is also very relevant to computer
        science. When looking at the lower levels of a computer, we see that
        computers only understand 0s and 1s which are numbers with a base of 2,
        instead of our usual base 10 in mathematics that we use. This is also known
        as machine language. When we program, we use identifiers and syntax that we
        can read and understand. As we compile, these programs are converted into
        0s and and return the result.
