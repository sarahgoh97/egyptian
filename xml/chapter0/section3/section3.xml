        Egyptian Fractions do not seem useful at first glance. However, there are
        a few possible areas of application. For example, some computers do not do
        division directly but uses multiplication with the reciprocal instead. In
        that case, Egyptian Fractions may be applied such that reciprocals or unit
        fractions can be useful for division computations.

        Another potential application is looking at resistors placed in parallel in
        a circuit. When resistors are placed in parallel, their total resistance is
        the inverse of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances, ie.

        \[\frac{1}{R_{tot}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... \]

        The right hand side has a similar representation as Egyptian Fractions. One
        possible way to make use of this is to come up with resistance values to get
        nicer round numbers for students that are learning about parallel
        resistors. Another possibility is to use the standard values of resistors
        and get the total resistance more easily instead of the usual tedious
        method of cross-multiplying and flipping the fractions.

        There may be other possible areas of application that have not yet been
        explored.
