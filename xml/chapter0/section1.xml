    Egyptian fractions are a unique way of representing and using fractions.
    This is because the Ancient Egyptians only used unit fractions which are
    fractions that have a numerator of 1. In other words, they only used
    reciprocals as fractions. For example,
    <LATEX>
      $\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{14}, 2^{-1}$
    </LATEX>
    are used by the Egyptians but
    <LATEX>
      $\frac{5}{6}, \frac{2}{14}$
    </LATEX>
    are not because their numerators are not 1. Hence, a different method is
    required to represent these fractions that have a numerator greater than 1.
    The Egyptians represented their fractions with positive, distinct unit
    fractions. Looking at the first example fraction,
    <LATEX>
      \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\]
    </LATEX>
    <LATEX>
      \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12}\]
    </LATEX>
    These representations are correct because they represent the fraction with
    distinct unit fractions. However, these examples would be wrong:
    <LATEX>
      \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\]
    </LATEX>
    This is wrong because the denominators in the second and third unit
    fractions are the same. Since the unit fractions are not distinct, this is
    an invalid representation.
    <LATEX>
      \[\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{6}\]
    </LATEX>
    This would also be wrong because the second unit fraction used is negative.

    Though Egyptian Fractions may seem vastly different from programming, it
    can help to explain the rationale of various essential concepts in
    programming to beginner students. Fractions are something basic that
    students have learnt at a young age and this could be useful in helping
    them to understand computing concepts which may be too abstract to grasp
    initially. This makes programming easier to grasp for new students. At the
    same time, the mathematical complexity behind Egyptian Fractions can
    engage students that can grasp the programming concepts easily. Egyptian
    Fractions can also provide context for the programs implemented.

    This is adapted from Martin Henz's book called ``Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs - JavaScript Adaptation" which can be
    found online at (https://source-academy.github.io/sicp/). This will cover
    the same concepts and will also be teaching JavaScript with the online
    environment developed by Henz (https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground).
     This provides a platform for students to learn programming with
    JavaScript in a more accessible manner.
