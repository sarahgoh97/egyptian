    Egyptians used hieroglyphs to represent their numbers. When they use
    fractions, an eye above the number to represent the unit fractions (insert
    from presentation.tex). There are also special fractions based on the Eye
    of Horus which use the power of 2. These are seen in the pictures below.

    As mentioned previously, Egyptians are limited in their representations of
    fractions but still needed a method of dividing wages among the workers.
    For example, when there are 5 sacks of rice as wages, the Egyptians used
    these fractions to split them among their 6 workers. In these cases, they
    built a table of fractions to keep track of how to divide the wages. This
    is evidenced by the Rhind Papyrus which came from about 1850BC. It contains
    a table of Egyptian Fraction representations mainly for fractions for 2/n,
    where the unit fractions used are distinct.

    With such tables, the Egyptians can use the unit fractions to decide how to
    split the wages. For example,

    $\frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}$

    This means that they can split the 5 bags into 2 groups. 3 of the bags can
    be split into halves while the other 2 can be split into thirds. From these,
    the taskmaster can give each worker a half and a third. This makes it
    easier for Egyptian taskmasters to give out wages for their workers. This is
    different from our modern methods of simply dividing each bag into 6 parts
    and giving each worker 5 of these parts.

    This example shows how Egyptian Fraction representations are different from
    our usage of ordinary fractions with a numerator greater than 1. Though it
    is not obvious how the Egyptians derive these representations, they seem to
    indicate the Egyptians used advanced mathematical concepts like the Sieve
    of Eratosthenes and practical numbers. This allows room for mathematical
    research in this area, which has been growing over the years.
