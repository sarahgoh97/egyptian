    The Egyptians did not have a concept of numbers other than integers. Even
    in their fractions they were represented by integers placed in a certain
    order. Likewise, when we deal with fractions we use 2 integers placed
    vertically and a line between them to show which is the numerator and the
    denominator. Hence, we will also limit ourselves to using only integers as
    we get into the programming. Though computers can represent non-integer
    numbers, they can be complicated to work with.

    As we see below, the numbers in the powers of 2 are special to the
    Egyptians. Likewise, the binary system is also very relevant to computer
    science. When looking at the lower levels of a computer, we see that
    computers only understand 0s and 1s which are numbers with a base of 2,
    instead of our usual base 10 in mathematics that we use. This is also known
    as machine language. When we program, we use identifiers and syntax that we
    can read and understand. As we compile, these programs are converted into
    0s and 1s for computers to understand and return the result.
