      Like the Source Academy, the JavaScript adaptation of SICP is an open-source community effort.
      The software and data required for making these web pages and the PDF edition are contained
      in the repository <LINK address="https://github.com/source-academy/sicp">Source Academy / sicp</LINK>,
      and improvements, extensions and discussions are handled in this repository as with many other
      open-source software projects.

      Martin Henz started translating SICP to JavaScript in 2008. He obtained the original
      <LaTeX/><SPACE/>sources of the book from Gerald Jay Sussman, and converted it to an XML
      format that allowed
      him to retain the original sources along with the JavaScript adaptation in a single file.
      He developed a processing system to generate HTML from XML, using XSLT, resulting in the
      first version of the JavaScript adaptation.

      The <LINK address="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg">mobile-friendly web edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Liu Hang
      in 2017 and then further developed by Feng Piaopiao in 2018, and by He Xinyue and Wang Qian in 2020.
      Formulas are retained in the resulting HTML files
      and are typeset by the reader's browser on the fly, using the MathJax system.
      The PDF edition was developed by Chan Ger Hean, using Node.js and <LATEX/> and the
      e-book edition by Jolyn Tan using Node.js and pandoc, both in 2019.

      In the book, program fragments often require other program fragments.
      In order to collect and execute the necessary programs, the corresponding
      <TT>SNIPPET</TT> tags in the xml files include <TT>REQUIRES</TT> tags. The Rails
      server uses these tags in order to assemble the executable programs.

      The <LINK address="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/sicpjs.pdf">PDF edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Chan Ger Hean in 2019.
      Ger Hean decided to use Node.js for generating <LATEX/> files from the XML sources.
      The <LATEX/> files are then typeset using the PdfLaTeX system.

      The <LINK address="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/sicpjs.epub">e-book edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Jolyn Tan in 2019.
      Jolyn decided to use Node.js for generating <LATEX/> files from the XML sources.
      The <LATEX/> files are then processed into the EPUB 3 format using the
      pandoc system.
